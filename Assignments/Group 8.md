## Relationship to visualize

In the Wikipedia data set, the column "geo" says if the location of the user that edited a page was known, unknown or contained an error.

Plot the amount of changes (Additions and Deletions) by the possible values of Geo and see if there's a relationship, and make a guess about what that might mean.
