#Instructions

## 1. (2min) Gather the following:

* at least 1 computer per group
* paper
* pencils, pens and markers

## 2. (2min) Choose a person for each of the following roles:

* **Presenter** - the person that will present the result of your work at the end of this exercise
* **Time Keeper** - time limits are going to be strictly enforced, so one person should be making sure work proceeds expeditely
* **Chart operator** - the person that will materially execute the charts

## 3. (15min) Analyze the data set

Spend some time trying to understand what kind of data is inside the data set you've been assigned. Mark the type of variable represented, and try to map on paper the splits you will need to operate in order to perform the visualization tasks you've been assigned.

After you are done with the splits, try to figure out which Apply operations you will need, then map the Combine step components to visualization components (coordinates, color, size etc...).

## 4. (25min) Visualize the data set

Visualize the data set according to the instructions you will find in your exercise sheet. You have 25 minutes to create 2 visualization of the same data set according to the principles explained tonight.

Your visualizations should vary in at least one significant way (use of a different mapping for the visualization components for example).

## 5. (1m) Deliver the visualizations for judging

The visualizations need to be deliver by sharing a Google Docs (presentation or diagram) with [luca.candela@gmail.com](mailto:luca.candela@gmail.com).

## 6. Relax, you've earned a cold beer!
